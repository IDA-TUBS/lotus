At IEEE IECON 2023, we presented our [proposal](https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-202310261026-0) on overlapping sample transmissions. This W2RP extensions has been designed in order to, among others, better cope with more challenging burst scenarios. [More information](https://ida-tubs.github.io/robustness/02_bursts/)

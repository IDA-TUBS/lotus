While our previous works on application-centric resource management addressed the coordination of multiple applications and network segments, they so far lacked detailed descriptions on how safety can actually be achieved given such a resource management approach. Our latest IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technolgy (TVT) [article](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2024.3415119) addresses these limitations by proposing a safe and synchronized reconfiguration protocol.

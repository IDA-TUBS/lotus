At IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) we presented both our works on Shared Slack Budgeting for Ultra Reliable Hard Real-Time Streaming ([paper](https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-202405020838-0)) and our first work on enabling continuous connectivity and large data streaming in roaming scenarios ([paper](https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-202405020845-0)).

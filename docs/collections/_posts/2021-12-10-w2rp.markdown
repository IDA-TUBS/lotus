Our first [paper](https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-202405030723-0) on enabling reliable sample transmissions has been published and presented at the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) 2021. The paper introduces the Wireless Reliable Real-Time Protocol (W2RP) and showcases its improvements over the MAC layer retransmissions of 802.11 as well as the off-the-shelf DDS middleware.

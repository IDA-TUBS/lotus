Check out [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUOEarpHoD8) for our video demonstrating the low-latency continuos connectivity and streaming approach using a physical demonstrator setup. Using a combination of [W2RP](https://github.com/IDA-TUBS/lwW2RP) and low overhead [link monitoring](https://github.com/IDA-TUBS/CC_LinkMonitor) we manage to achieve deterministic handovers in less than 10ms, thereby enabling reliable streaming of large data despite the challenges caused by roaming situations.

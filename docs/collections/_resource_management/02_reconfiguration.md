A dedicated reconfiguration protocol hat takes into account the safety constraints required to ensure safety in a system where the RM coordinates safety-critical systems is currently being developed.

<!-- A dedicated reconfiguration protocol that takes into account the safety constraints required to ensure safety in a system where the RM coordinates safety-critical systems has been developed. 
The combination of heartbeat-based connection monitoring, protection against inherent message loss, node-level fail-silent behavior and synchronized mode changes the RM ensures safety by enforcing consistent application (and network) modes across the wireless network.
The coordination principles have further been extended with respect to letting applications on a single node share resources ('shared slack') to enable more efficient resource utilization and better cope with dynamic backward error correction (BEC) that are to be expected in wireless channels. -->

Due to its shared nature, the wireless channel is used by various applications of different criticalities and with different requirements and constraints.
This makes timing guarantees impractical, as long as no coordination is used.
A centralized application-centric Resource Management (RM) approach that is based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles (communication divided into control and data plane) has been developed to address the coordination of various wireless applications.

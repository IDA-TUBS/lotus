Handover situations, such as present in infrastructure-supported cooperative perception use cases such as automated valet parking (AVP) or camera-equipped intersections, are especially taxing with respect to enable reliable and timely data exchange.
The mobile nature of vehicles inherently leads to the need for roaming across multiple access points (APs), as shadowing by stationary (e.g., walls, vegetation, ...) and dynamic (e.g., other vehicles, ...) obstacles will occur frequently, especially in case high-data rate technologies are used.
This is already the case if small messages are exchanged, and becomes even more challenging if large object data streams with stringent real-time and reliability constraints are considered.
Nevertheless, reliable and continuous sample exchange needs to be ensured in order to enable the corresponding use cases.

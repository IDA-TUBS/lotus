	abstract = {The current roadmaps and surveys for future wireless networking typically focus on communication and networking technologies and use representative applications to derive future network requirements. Such a benchmarking approach, however, does not cover the application integration challenge that arises from the many distributed applications sharing a network infrastructure, each with their individual topology and data structure. The paper addresses V2X networks as an important example. Crucial end-to-end application constraints including real-time and safety encourage a closer look at application interference and systematic integration. This perspective paper proposes a two-layer resource management that divides the problem into an application integration and a network management task. Valet parking with high-resolution infrastructure camera support is elaborated as a use case that overarches vehicle network and wireless network management. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of complementing the current network-centric management by an application-centric integration.},

	abstract = {We present a middleware-based protocol that reliably synchronizes large samples consisting of multiple frames efficiently and within application level QoS requirements over a lossy wireless channel. The protocol uses a custom retransmission scheme, exploiting the latency requirements on sample level for frame level scheduling. It can be integrated into the popular DDS middleware. We investigate some technical limits of such a protocol and compare it to existing error protocols in the software stack and in the wireless protocol and combinations thereof. The comparison is based on an Omnet++ simulation using an established wireless channel error model. For evaluation, we take a use case from automated valet parking where infrastructure data provided via a wireless link augments in-vehicle sensor data. The use case respects the related safety requirements. Results show that the application awareness of the presented protocol, significantly improves service availability by transmitting data efficiently in time even under higher frame error rates.},

	abstract = {Fully autonomous driving applications rely on a complete knowledge of their operational environment to ensure safety while maintaining efficient driving. However, in scenarios with close visual restrictions, such as urban traffic, the lack of sensor data leads to a safety-related degradation of the autonomous service. Collaborative sensing, describing the timely wireless transmission of additional large external sensor data, can fill this information gap. However, real-time protocols for error-protected transmission of sensor data that also consider load dynamics as well as link prioritization are not available. To make the channel usable for such collaborative sensing requirements, even in challenging load scenarios, we introduce an adaptive minimum distance shaping mechanism of fragments that exploits the round-trip time information from the protocol’s error protection mechanism. We place that mechanism in the context of the IEEE 802.11p WLAN-based V2X software stack and evaluate them with an OMNeT++ simulation. The results show that link robustness is achieved under varying load conditions while channel access and load injection follow the expected prioritization.},

	abstract = {There is a trend towards communication of larger data objects in wireless vehicle communication. In many cases, communication uses publish-subscribe protocols. Data rate requirements of such protocols are best addressed by wireless multicast protocols, but the existing protocols lack an error protection that is suitable for real-time and safety-critical applications. We present an application-aware protocol that supports the popular DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware. By exploiting data object deadlines and slack for retransmissions and employing an adaptable, multicast-aware prioritization mechanism the reliable exchange of large data objects is enabled. The protocol is sufficiently general to be used on top of different communication standards such as 802.11- and cellular-based V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) technologies. The protocol was implemented in an OMNeT++ simulation model and evaluated against recent state-of-the-art alternatives using parameters and constraints taken from a motivational truck platooning example. Furthermore, the protocol was implemented using an open-source DDS implementation as the basis and tested on a physical wireless demonstrator setup. The evaluation shows that the presented multicast protocol substantially outperforms the alternatives keeping streaming applications operational even under high frame error rates.},

	abstract = {In this article, we present a middleware protocol, that transmits larger-than-a-frame data samples within application real-time and reliability requirements over a lossy wireless channel. The protocol efﬁciently deploys an intelligent retransmission control that exploits the extended deadline requirements of a sample for frame-level scheduling. The transmission of such samples is placed in the context of the necessary integration of such external sensor data into the decision-making process of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we provide parameterization and access rules for communication links in resource-managed scenarios and lay out how to integrate the protocol into the popular DDS middleware. The performance of the parameterized links to satisfy their reliability requirements is studied and compared to error protection protocols in the current software stack. We base the evaluation on an OMNeT++ simulation, whereby an established wireless error model is used. The use case is placed in the context of collaborative sensing in a valet parking environment, where external infrastructure sensor data augments the autonomous vehicle’s data processing chain via a lossy wireless link. Thereby, the use case adheres to the underlying safety requirements. Results show that if the protocol’s awareness of the application requirements is used for parameterization, guarantees for reliability can be provided that outperform existing solutions.},

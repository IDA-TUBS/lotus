The *Wireless Research Group* of the Institute of Computer and Network Engineering, Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig (Germany), is actively working on the challenge of enabling reliable and real-time capable transmission of large data objects in the context of Vehicle-to-X communication.

Current research topics comprise error-correction under stringent real-time constraints in general, and providing continuous connectivity to prevent connection loss during handover events for infrastructure-based applications.

Our proposales are tested via simulation frameworks such as [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/), which is the basis for the [IDAWirelessSimulator](https://github.com/IDA-TUBS/IDAWirelessSimulator). 
However, we are also dedicated to build physical demonstrators to further verify our results.
